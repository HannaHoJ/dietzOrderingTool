- Problem on showing categories in German not in englisch. index.js function has to be changed probably

- page_milk needs own product milk template to be shown as list

- binding in header and footer components on page

- product category index page --> milk products list with diffrent items --> single selected milk product

- connect items in the product data base with the :category templates

- Order collections

- add to order  --> insert in order 

- create a order list containing: product number, amount, name of product, calculating total price, delete button.
		-> has to be bound to user: 


- error handling

- validation of loggin, adding orders...
